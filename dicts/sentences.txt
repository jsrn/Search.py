well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes
but i warn you if you dont tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichristi really believe he is antichristi will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened yousit down and tell me all the news
it was in july  and the speaker was the wellknown anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna
with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception
anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days
she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st
petersburg used only by the elite
all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows
if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between  and annette scherer
heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception
he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face
he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court
he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa
first of all dear friend tell me how you are
set your friends mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned
can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna
you are staying the whole evening i hope
and the fete at the english ambassadors today is wednesday
i must put in an appearance there said the prince
my daughter is coming for me to take me there
i thought todays fete had been canceled
i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome
if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed
dont tease well and what has been decided about novosiltsevs dispatch you know everything
what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone
what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours
prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part
anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness
to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her
the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out
oh dont speak to me of austria
perhaps i dont understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war
she is betraying us russia alone must save europe
our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it
that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him
he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one
whom i ask you can we rely on
england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders loftiness of soul
she has refused to evacuate malta
she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions
what answer did novosiltsev get none
the english have not understood and cannot understand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind
and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him
and i dont believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either
this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap
i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch
he will save europe
she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity
i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussias consent by assault
you are so eloquent
will you give me a cup of tea
in a moment
a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families
he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones
and also the abbe morio
do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor
had you heard
i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince
but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature
prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron
anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with
baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone
as she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness
she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness
the prince was silent and looked indifferent
but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said
now about your family
do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful
the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude
i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed
why has fate given you two such splendid children i dont speak of anatole your youngest
i dont like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows
two such charming children
and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you dont deserve to have them
and she smiled her ecstatic smile
i cant help it said the prince
lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity
dont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you
do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her majestys and you were pitied
the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply
he frowned
what would you have me do he said at last
you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one
that is the only difference between them
he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant
and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively
i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life
it is the cross i have to bear
that is how i explain it to myself
it cant be helped
he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture
anna pavlovna meditated
have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked
they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i dont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who is very unhappy with her father
she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya
prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information
do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added thats what we fathers have to put up with
is this princess of yours rich
her father is very rich and stingy
he lives in the country
he is the wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia
he is very clever but eccentric and a bore
the poor girl is very unhappy
she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately
he is an aidedecamp of kutuzovs and will be here tonight
listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna pavlovnas hand and for some reason drawing it downwards
arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports
she is rich and of good family and thats all i want
and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction
attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak to lise young bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged
it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my apprenticeship as old maid
the sable night had spun out half her course when don quixote and sancho entered toboso
a profound silence reigned over all the town and the inhabitants were fast asleep and stretched out at their ease
nothing disturbed the general tranquillity but now and then the barking of dogs that wounded don quixotes ears but more poor sanchos heart
sometimes an ass brayed hogs grunted cats mewed which jarring mixture of sounds was not a little augmented by the stillness and serenity of the night and filled the enamoured champions head with a thousand inauspicious chimeras
nevertheless he said sancho lead on to dulcineas palace it is possible we may find her awake
to what palace answered sancho that in which i saw her highness was but a little mean house
it was i suppose some small apartment of her castle which she had retired to said the knight to amuse herself with her damsels as is usual with great ladies and princesses
since your worship quoth sancho will needs have my lady dulcineas house to be a castle is this an hour to find the gates open first however let us find this castle replied don quixote and then i will tell thee how to actbut look my eyes deceive me or that huge dark pile yonder must be dulcineas palace
then lead on sir said sancho it may be so though if i were to see it with my eyes i will believe it just as much as that it is now day
the don led the way and having gone about two hundred paces he came up to the edifice which cast the dark shade and perceiving a large tower he soon found that the building was no palace but the principal church of the place whereupon he said we are come to the church sancho
i see we are answered sancho and pray god we be not come to our graves for it is no good sign to be rambling about churchyards at such hours and especially since i have already told your worship that this same ladys house stands in a blind alley
blockhead said the knight where hast thou ever found castles and royal palaces built in blind alleys sir said sancho each country has its customs so perhaps it is the fashion here to build your palaces in alleys and so i beseech your worship to let me look among these lanes and alleys just before me and perhaps i may pop upon this same palace which i wish i may see devoured by dogs for bewildering us at this rate
speak with more respect sancho of what regards my lady said don quixote let us keep our holidays in peace and not throw the rope after pg  the bucket
i will curb myself answered sancho but i cannot think that though i have seen the house but once your worship will needs have me find it at midnight when you cannot find it yourself though you must have seen it thousands of times
thou wilt make me desperate sancho quoth don quixote come hither heretic have i not told thee a thousand times that i never saw the peerless dulcinea in my life nor ever stepped over the threshold of her palace and that i am enamoured by report alone and the great fame of her wit and beauty i hear it now said sancho and to tell the truth i have seen her just as much as your worship
how can that be cried don quixote didst thou not tell me that thou sawest her winnowing wheat take no heed of that sir replied the squire for the fact is her message and the sight of her too were both by hearsay and i can no more tell who the lady dulcinea is than i can buffet the moon
sancho sancho answered don quixote there is a time to jest and a time when jests are unseasonable
what because i say that i never saw nor spoke to the mistress of my soul must thou say so likewise when thou knowest it to be untrue
they were here interrupted by the approach of a man with two mules and by the sound of a ploughshare our travellers rightly guessed that he was a husbandman
the countryfellow having now come up to them don quixote said to him goodmorrow honest friend canst thou direct me to the palace of the peerless princess donna dulcinea del toboso sir answered the fellow i am a stranger here for i have been but a few days in the service of a farmer of this town
but the parish priest or the sexton across the road can give your worship an account of that same lady princess for they keep a register of all the inhabitants of toboso not that i think there is any princess living here though there are several great ladies that may every one be a princess in her own house
among those friend said the don may be her for whom i am inquiring
not unlikely said the ploughman and so god speed you for it will soon be daybreak
then pricking on his mules he waited for no more questions
sancho seeing his master perplexed said to him sir the day comes on apace and we shall soon have the sun upon us so i think we had better get out of this place and while your worship takes shelter in some wood i will leave not a corner unsearched for this house castle or palace of my lady and it shall go hard with me but i find it and as soon as i have done so i will speak to her ladyship and tell her where your worship is waiting her orders and directions how you may see her without damage to her honour and reputation
sancho quoth don quixote thou hast uttered a thousand sentences in a few words
thy counsel i relish much and shall most willingly follow it
pg  come on and let us seek for some shelter then shalt thou return and seek out my lady from whose discretion and courtesy i expect more than miraculous favours
sancho was impatient till he got his master out of the town lest his tricks should be detected he therefore hastened on and when they had gone about two miles the knight retired to a shady grove while the squire returned in quest of the lady dulcinea on which embassy things occurred well worthy of credit and renewed attention
having retired a little apart the squire of the wood said to sancho this is a toilsome life we squires to knightserrant lead in good truth we eat our bread by the sweat of our brows which is one of the curses god laid upon our first parents
you may say too that we eat it by the frost of our bodies added sancho for who has to bear more cold as well as heat than your miserable squires to knighterrantry it would not be quite so bad if we could always get something to eat for good fare lessens care but how often we must pass whole days without breaking our fastunless it be upon air all this may be endured quoth he of the wood with the hopes of reward for that knighterrant must be unlucky indeed who does not speedily recompense his squire with at least a handsome government or some pretty earldom
i replied sancho have already told my master that i should be satisfied with the government of an island and he is so noble and so generous that he has promised it me a thousand times
and i said he of the wood should think myself amply rewarded for all my services with a canonry and i have my masters word for it too
why then quoth sancho belike your master is some knight of the church and so can bestow rewards of that kind on his squires mine is only a layman
some of his wise friends advised him once to be an archbishop but he would be nothing but an emperor and i trembled all the while lest he should take a liking to the church because you must know i am not gifted that way to say the truth sir though i look like a man i am a very beast in such matters
let me tell you friend quoth he of the wood you are quite in the wrong for these islandgovernments are often more plague than profit
some are crabbed some beggarly somein short the best of them are sure to bring more care than they are worth and are mostly too heavy for the shoulders that have to bear them
i suspect it would be wiser in us to quit this thankless drudgery and stay at home where we may find easier work and better pastime for he must be a sorry squire who has not his nag his brace of greyhounds and an anglingrod to enjoy himself with at home
i am not without these things answered sancho it is true i have no horse but then i have an ass which is worth twice as much as my masters steed
i would not swap with him though he should offer me four bushels of barley to boot no that would not i though you may take for a joke the price i set upon my dapplefor dapple sir is the colour pg  of my ass
greyhounds i cannot be in want of as our town is overstocked with them besides the rarest sporting is that we find at other peoples cost
really and truly brother squire answered he of the wood i have resolved with myself to quit the frolics of these knightserrant and get home again and look after my children for i have three like indian pearls
and i have two quoth sancho fit to be presented to the pope himself in person especially my girl that i am breeding up for a countess if it please god in spite of her mother
but i beseech god to deliver me from this dangerous profession of squireship into which i have run a second time drawn and tempted by a purse of a hundred ducats which i found one day among the mountains
in truth my fancy is continually setting before my eyes here there and everywhere a bag full of gold pistoles so that methinks at every step i am laying my hand upon it hugging it and carrying it home buying lands settling rents and living like a prince and while this runs in my head i can bear all the toil which must be suffered with this foolish master of mine who to my knowledge is more of the madman than the knight
indeed friend said the squire of the wood you verify the proverb which says that covetousness bursts the bag
 truly friend now you talk of madmen there is not a greater one in the world than my master
the old saying may be applied to him other folks burdens break the asss back for he gives up his own wits to recover those of another and is searching after that which when found may chance to hit him in the teeth
by the way he is in love it seems said sancho
yes quoth he of the wood with one casildea de vandalia one of the most whimsical dames in the world but that is not the foot he halts on at present he has some other crotchets in his pate which we shall hear more of anon
there is no road so even but it has its stumbling places replied sancho in other folks houses they boil beans but in mine whole kettles full
madness will have more followers than discretion but if the common saying is true that there is some comfort in having partners in grief i may comfort myself with you who serve as crackbrained a master as my own
crackbrained but valiant answered he of the wood and more knavish than either
mine answered sancho has nothing of the knave in him so far from it he has a soul as pure as a pitcher and would not harm a fly he bears no malice and a child may persuade him it is night at noonday for which i love him as my life and cannot find in my heart to leave him in spite of all his pranks
for all that brother quoth he of the wood if the blind lead the blind both may fall into the ditch
we had better turn us fairly about and go back to our homes for they who seek adventures find them sometimes to their cost
